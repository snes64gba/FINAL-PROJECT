    <h5> Mario Kart Double Dash!!; released in 2003 for the Nintendo Gamecube. Featuring eleven new playable characters (Daisy, Birdo, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr., Paratroopa, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Waluigi, Petey Piranha, King Boo, and Toadette.) Featuring two racers per kart, and the addition of special items. It is the predecessor of the DS' Mario Kart DS, and the successor of the GBA's Mario Kart: Super Circuit. The game features 16 tracks. Double Dash also contains karts for different characters.
    <h1> Cast</h1>
    <h5> Mario and Luigi; Peach and Daisy; Yoshi and Birdo; Baby Mario and Baby Luigi; Toad and Toadette; Koopa and Paratroopa; Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong; Bowser and Bowser Jr.; Wario and Waluigi; Petey Piranha and King Boo.
    <h1> Mushroom Cup</h1>
    <h5> The four tracks in the Mushroom Cup, consist of Luigi Circuit, Peach Beach, Baby Park, and Dry Dry Desert. Luigi Circuit is a basic figure 8 course. The only obstacle is a Chain Chomp. Luigi Circuit makes a return in Mario Kart DS. Peach Beach is takes place in Delfino Island, where the terrain is mostly sand. Cataquacks (big ducks) will obnoxiously come in your path, attempting to flip your kart. This course reappears in Mario Kart Wii. Baby Park is the shortest course in the series. It's so short it requires 7 laps. Taking place in an amusement park, it is very chaotic. Items make Baby Park, the wreck. It makes a reappearance in both Mario Kart DS, and Mario Kart 8. Dry Dry Desert, is the last course in the Mushroom Cup. Starting off there is a giant twister, attempting to get you in the air. There is a giant piranha plant in the quicksand that will eat you if you get too close. In the remake in Mario Kart 8, the section with the Pokeys is replaced by an oasis, which was a fantastic new touch.
    <h1> Flower Cup</h1>
    <h5> The four tracks in the Flower Cup, consist of Mushroom Bridge, Mario Circuit, Daisy Cruiser, Waluigi Stadium. Mushroom Bridge, is another version of Toad's Turnpike from Mario Kart 64. New vehicles include the Mushroom Kart which gives a free mushroom if you collide with it, The Wiggler Bus, and the Bob-omb Kart. If you happen to run into one, you will explode. Mushroom Bridge makes a return in Mario Kart DS. Mario Circuit takes place at Peach's Castle. Avoid the Chain Chomp, Goombas, and Piranha Plants that will try to munch on you. This course returns in Mario Kart Wii. Daisy Cruiser lies in the middle of the ocean. Featuring a swimming pool, that cannot be driven in, a hidden basement shortcut, and furniture, that shifts back and forth. Daisy Cruiser returns in Mario Kart 7, and the pool allows you drive in, and the basement is filled with water, where creatures live. Waluigi Stadium is the final course in the Flower Cup. Kinda like Wario Stadium for the N64, Waluigi Stadium takes place in a dirtbike arena, with Mecha-Piranha Plants that will try to chomp at you. The track is fairly muddy as well. Waluigi Stadium makes an appearance in Mario Kart Wii.
    <h1> Star Cup </h1>
    <h5> The four tracks in the Star Cup, consist of Sherbet Land, Mushroom City, Yoshi Circuit, and DK Mountain. Sherbet Land is a slippery terrain course featuring no penguins unlike the N64 version. If you fall in the ice water or touch a Freezie, you will turn into a block of ice. At the beginning of the course, Shy Guy skaters will be a minor hazard. Also this course is 65% ice and 35% snow. Sherbet Land reappears in Mario Kart 8. Mushroom City has not reappeared in any game yet. It's  basically Mushroom Bridge at nighttime, with all the same elements. Yoshi Circuit is a track in the shape of Yoshi. There are a couple of shortcuts, and Piranha Plants that try to snack on you. This track reappears in both Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart 8. The final track in the Star Cup is DK Mountain. Starting at the bottom of the mountain, you drive up to a DK Barrel Cannon, drive down the mountain, through the jungle, and repeat. Towards the end there's a rickety bridge with no guardrails. So if you wanna be a troll, you can place a Giant Banana right in the middle of the bridge, and someone is guaranteed to fall off. This track makes the Lightning Cup in Mario Kart Wii.
    <h1> Special Cup </h1>
    <h5> The four tracks in the Special Cup, consist of Wario Colosseum, Dino Dino Jungle, Bowser's Castle, and the infamous Rainbow Road. Only one of these tracks reappears as a retro stage, that being Dino Dino Jungle in Mario Kart 7. Wario Colosseum is so large that it only requires 2 laps. There are no obstacles on this track. Dino Dino Jungle takes place in a prehistoric jungle. First you'll drive through a dinosaur's legs, then onto a pathway of three bridges. One of them has a speed boost, but is difficult to cross over. From there you drive into a cave, with geysers. If you're a small racer then you might get knocked off. Unless you take the shortcut, which requires a Star or Mushroom. Finally you'll end up on a bridge, where the dinosaur's head will, be and you'll reach the finish where more geysers are arrive. Driving into Bowser's Castle, you will avoid Thwomps, drive into a lava area, make a turn, avoid fire, then face a Giant Bowser Statue. The castle is surrounded by a purple moat. Rainbow Road features a rainbow road and shows the special items of characters in the air. There is also a cannon. Stars will fall out of the sky they will be useable for anyone who picks one up.
    <h1> Special Items </h1>
    <h5> Everyone in the game has there own special item (except for King Boo and Petey Piranha who use all of them). This added strategy to the game. Mario and Luigi own the Red and Green Fireballs. Basically they are a set of five fireballs used to burn opponents...I guess. Princess Peach and Princess Daisy own the Heart Barrier. Any item found on the ground, or thrown at them, can be picked up, and used for themselves. This tends to mostly be bananas or fake item boxes. Yoshi and Birdo own the Egg. When you throw one, it cracks and releases item such as shells, mushrooms, stars, bananas, or bob-ombs open to anyone. The Babies' special item is the Chain Chomp. Pretty cute, how little babies get to control one of the most powerful special items in the game. Toad and Toadette get the Golden Mushroom, used for infinite speed boosts. Koopa and Paratroopa own Triple Shells, used to launch triple green or triple red shells at opponents. Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong host the Giant Banana, which takes up a lot of space, wherever it happens to be placed. Bowser and Bowser Jr., have the Bowser Shell, used like a regular green shell, but larger and way more destructive. Finally Wario and Waluigi have access to the Bob-omb, which explodes after a few seconds, or when in contact.
