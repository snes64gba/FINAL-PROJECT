    <h1>Mario Kart 64 Guide</h1>
    <h5>Mario Kart 64; released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64. Featuring two new playable characters with Wario (top left) and Donkey Kong (next to Wario). Before the name "Mario Kart 64", the game was orignially called "Mario Kart R". Also Kamek was going to be a playable character and was removed for unknown reasons. The game features 16 tracks along with 7 added items to make a total of 14. It is the predecessor of the GBA's Mario Kart: Super Circuit and the successor of the SNES' Super Mario Kart </h5>
    <h1>Cast</h1>
    <h5>Mario: Well-Rounded, Hard to Knock Down; Luigi: Maintains Speed, Good on Turns; Peach: Fast Out the Gate, Stellar Control; Toad: Lightweight and Nimble; Yoshi: Hits Top Speed the Fastest; Donkey Kong: Brutish and Consistent; Wario: Best Heavyweight for Beginners; Bowser: Fastest, Most Stolid Heavyweight</h5>
    <h1> Game Modes</h1>
    <h5> There are four original modes to the game. Grand Prix has one or two players participate in four consecutive three-lap races, each on a different course; from the (Mushroom, Flower, Star, or Special) against seven (or six) computer players. If a player places first through fourth they are rewarded nine, six, three, or one point. Finishing fifth and below requires the racer repeat that course. Difficulty is measured by engine size: 50cc, 100cc, 150cc. There is an Extra Mode where all the courses are flipped. This would eventually be called Mirror Mode in later installments. Time Trials is a single player mode, where the objective is to complete a three-lap course in the shortest time possible. There are no item boxes or opponents. Ghost data, mimics, your old status, and you attempt beating it. Versus mode is where two to four players race on any track without computer players. Battle Mode has a last man standing objective, where players collect items, in attempt to burst opponents balloons. Mini-Bob-omb Karts can smash into you (only in VS - Battle Mode)
    <h1> Mushroom Cup</h1>
    <h5> The Mushroom Cup's skill level is for beginners. It consists of four courses; Luigi Raceway, Moo Moo Farm, Koopa Troopa Beach, and Kalimari Desert. Luigi Raceway is a simple layout course that appears very boring. It only features a hot-air balloon with an item box. Luigi Raceway reappeared in Mario Kart 7. Moo Moo Farm is another basic course in an oval featuring moles as obstacles. Nothing really stands out about the course. It reappeared in Mario Kart DS. Koopa Troopa Beach features an island with a Koopa Troopa Rock and Sidesteppers as minor enemies. Kalimari Desert is a canyon, featuring some cacti, and the N64 Express. Both Koopa Troopa Beach and Kalimari Desert made a return in Mario Kart 7.
    <h1>Flower Cup</h1>
    <h5> The Flower Cup's skill level is more intermediate. It consits of four courses; Toad's Turnpike, Frappe Snowland, Choco Mountain, and Mario Raceway. Toad's Turnpike is the first course in the series to feature other vehicles such as trucks and cars to drive on the course with you. It is very difficult. Item boxes are placed on the sides of the course. This course reappears in Mario Kart 8. Frappe Snowland takes place in a snowy area, filled with snowmen. If you run into one, your game is probably over. Also falling into the water can freeze you, and it takes Lakitu like 8 years to pick you up. Choco Mountain features a chocolate road similar to the SNES' Choco Island. Falling off the edge, forces you to restart a huge portion of the track. Frappe Snowland and Choco Mountain reappeared in Mario Kart DS. The final course Mario Raceway is similar to Luigi Raceway consists of in place Piranha Plants and a huge halfpipe towards the end. There's a crowd cheering you on. Other than that there's not much else to say. Mario Raceway reappears in Mario Kart Wii.
    <h1> Star Cup</h1>
    <h5> Star Cup is probably the hardest cup in the game. It's skill level is set hard. The four courses in this cup are; Wario Stadium, Sherbet Land, Royal Raceway, and Bowser's Castle. All of these tracks include supersharp 90 degree turns that will have you launching the game controller at you window. Wario Stadium takes place in a dirtbike arena, with no obstacles. The main hell is this course is the giant jump at the end. If your not going full speed, prepare to redo 75% of the track. This track has not reappeared as a retro stage. Sherbet Land is slippery terrain filled with adorable penguins. But don't be fooled, these penguins are an adorable hell. When you reach the cave, the penguins will circle the cavern and bump into you. Also about 85% of this track is covered in slippery ice. This track makes a return in Mario Kart Wii. Royal Raceway features the longest jump in the series. Consisting of about five sharp turns, and Piranha Plants. This course reappears in Mario Kart 8. One of the hardest courses in this game is Bowser's Castle. Lots of Thwomps, a rickety bridge that might drop you in lava, and sharp turns leading out into the garden. The Thwomps are bitches, also trying to target you and get in your way. Bowser's Castle reappears in Mario Kart Wii.
    <h1> Special Cup</h1>
    <h5> Special Cup is the final cup in the game. It's not expert, but it's still pretty challenge. The four courses consists of; DK's Jungle Parkway, Yoshi Valley, Banshee Boardwalk, and Rainbow Road. In DK's Jungle Parkway includes very sharp turns as well as a narrow bridge that is difficult to pass. If you land on the grass, spiky fruits will be launched in your direction. DK's Jungle Parkway makes a return in Mario Kart Wii. Yoshi Valley is so complicated, that the ranking system can't tell who's in what place. Featuring many twists, turns, ups, and downs, this course has its fair share. There are porcupines that can be difficult to dodge, and if you fall into the canyon, good look coming back. There is also a giant Yoshi egg. Yoshi Valley reappears in Mario Kart 8. For being incredibly challenging and pitch black, Banshee Boardwalk comes out as one of the hardest Mario Kart 64 tracks. The turns are ridiculously sharp, and once you fall into the water, it'll take Lakitu like a decade to pick you up. So your only chances of winning the race are...Stars. The house features Swoopers, that will make you spin-out if you make contact with them. Banshee Boardwalk reappeared in Mario Kart DS. Mario Kart 64's Rainbow Road is the longest track in the series (2000m) taking 2 minutes to complete 1 lap. Since there are guardrails everywhere, shells are useless. Your only hope is the Blue Shell. Chomps appear about twice per lap, but don't cause much damage. N64 Rainbow Road, reappears in Mario Kart 8, as a race to the finish course, instead of three laps, due to the length of the course.
    <h1>Items</h1>
    <h5> the items, decide how the race will go from start to finish. There are a total of 14 items in Mario Kart 64 (seven returning and seven new). The Banana is a basic that makes you spin out, it's counterpart the *Banana Bunch is five bananas for spinning out opponents. The Green Shell is a basic throwing item, used to hit opponents, and the Red Shell is a homing item, used to target the racer directly in front of your kart. Both these items have triple counterparts (*Triple Red Shells and *Triple Green Shells). The Mushroom is used to give your kart a speed boost. The *Triple Mushroom is its counterpart giving you three mushrooms instead of one. The Star is used to make you invincible, and knocking anything out in your path. You can get a star in up to second place. The Ghost steals the best item available from an opponent. If there are no items available...nothing happens. Lightning Bolts, are used to shrink everyone. When small you can be crushed, by other drivers. If you have fallen off the course, are a ghost, or in star form, lightning does not affect you. The *Golden Mushroom, gives you an infinite speed boost. *Fake Item Boxes, are troll boxes, used to confuse opponents, and the *Spiny Shell, is a blue projectile, whom chases down first place, and explodes. *New Items
