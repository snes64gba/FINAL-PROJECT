    <h1> Mushroom Cup </h1>
    <h5> Mushroom Cup is the basic cup featuring Figure-8 Circuit, Yoshi Falls, Cheep Cheep Beach, and Luigi's Mansion. Figure-8 Circuit is a basic figure 8 course, with no gimmicks. It is also where the ceremony is held. Figure-8 Circuit has not returned as a retro track. Yoshi Falls is a canyon, with a giant egg in the center, there are a series of bridges and waterfalls that are to been riden across. Yoshi Falls returns to Mario Kart DS. Cheep Cheep Beach is a shallow beach, with deep waters, and tropical area. Sidesteppers crawl around the area trying to throw you off course. Cheep Cheep Beach returns to Mario Kart 8. Luigi's Mansion is the final course in the Mushroom Cup. After driving through the dark mansion, you'll end up in the dark forest, and the terrain is slippery mud, and walking trees. Luigi's Mansion returns to Mario Kart 7.
    <h1> Flower Cup </h1>
    <h5> The four tracks featured in Flower Cup are; Desert Hills, Delfino Square, Waluigi Pinball, and Shroom Ridge. Desert Hills takes place in an arid desert, while the Angry Sun generates Fire Snakes, that bounce around and attempt to burn players. There's a section with sand dunes and Pokeys, and then the part with the sand hills. Delfino Square takes place in a Delfino Isle. The best parts of the course are the hidden shortcut through the mud, and the drawbridge near the end. Desert Hills and Delfino Square return in Mario Kart Wii. Waluigi Stadium has hit the top of most Top 10 lists. Imagine being shot out of a cannon, driving through a pinball machine and doing it all over again. When an item box is hit it makes a roulette sound. Waluigi Pinball reappeares in Mario Kart 7. Shroom Ridge is a spinoff of Mushroom Bridge from Mario Kart Double Dash!!. Driving around and avoiding vehicles. That's it. This course has not returned.
    <h1> Star Cup </h1>
    <h5> The four tracks featured in Star Cup are; DK Pass, Tick-Tock Clock, Mario Circuit, and Airship Fortress. At the beginning of DK Pass, you begin at the bottom of a snowy mountain. You then make your way up the mountain, while avoiding snowmen and snowballs. There is a secret item box containing only a star or mushrooms. Toward the end there's a section with snowmen, kinda like the N64's Frappe Snowland. DK Pass returns in Mario Kart 7. Tick Tock Clock takes place inside of a giant clock. While manuevering through the clock, you are to avoid clock hands and gears. Tick Tock Clock returns in Mario Kart 8. Mario Circuit is probably the most boring Mario Circuit in the series. The SNES versions were way better. I have no other comments, other than is has not made a return in any game. Airship Fortress is the final course in Star Cup. Start by driving straight at Bullet Bills are launched right in your direction. From there, turn and avoid Rocky Wrenches, and flames. Then get shot out of a cannon and return to the finish line. Airship Fortress returns in Mario Kart 7.
    <h1> Special Cup </h1>
    <h5> The four tracks featured in Special Cup are; Wario Stadium, Peach Gardens, Bowser Castle and Rainbow Road. Wario Stadium from the N64 and DS are way different. The same dirtbike concept, just with alot more mud, firebars, and extreme jumps. Wario Stadium returns in Mario Kart 8, with an added water feature and Wario Statue. Somehow Chain Chomps found there way in Peach Gardens, but this course is phenonmenal. The amount of outstandingness in this course are great. Driving through a garden run by Chain Chomps and infested with Monty Moles. Peach Gardens returns in Mario Kart Wii. Although Bowser Castle does not return in any game. It's stil a fantastic course. It's not the greatest course however. This course features a spinning bridge. That's its. Other than that is just pretty long. Same with Rainbow Road, it's just a bland course with lots of colors.
